    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
        There are two players representing the @ symbol, and they move around with the arrow keys. When your player is red, it's your turn.
        Each player take turns making their move, and they can move around to pick up gold, kill monsters, pick up potions, or kill each other.
        When a player gets killed it will respawn on a random empty spot.
        Every 50 turns there's a gold round which means that gold will be spread out across the map.
